# SIMPLE VERCEL DASHBOARD FIX

## The Easiest Solution

Instead of complex configurations, use these exact settings in your Vercel dashboard:

### Build & Output Settings:
```
Build Command: cd client && npx vite build
Output Directory: client/dist
Install Command: npm install
Root Directory: (leave blank)
```

### Why This Works:
- `cd client` - Navigate to the React app folder
- `npx vite build` - Build only the frontend (no server)
- `client/dist` - Output goes to the right folder

### Steps:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Find "Build & Output Settings"
3. Set the values above
4. Save and redeploy

This avoids all the complex Vite configuration issues and just builds the React app directly.

## Alternative Git Fix:
I've also updated the vercel.json file. Push these changes:

```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Simplify Vercel build config"
git push origin main
```

Either method will fix the build error.
