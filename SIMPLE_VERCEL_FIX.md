# Simple Vercel Fix - Static Site Deployment

## The Issue
Your build is working perfectly and creating files in `dist/public/`, but Vercel needs the right configuration to serve them properly.

## New Simplified vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## What This Does:
- ✅ Uses your working `npm run build` command
- ✅ Points to the correct output directory `dist/public`
- ✅ Handles React Router by serving `index.html` for all routes
- ✅ No complex API setup - just static site deployment

## Push This Fix:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Simplify Vercel config for static React deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Build Verification:
Your build creates these files correctly:
- `dist/public/index.html` (2.19 kB)
- `dist/public/assets/index--Ry9gK6O.css` (89.03 kB)
- `dist/public/assets/index-D55hosAL.js` (1,266.01 kB)

This configuration should deploy your React app properly to Vercel.

## Expected Result:
- Root URL: Shows login page
- /dashboard: Shows dashboard (handled by React Router)
- All routes work correctly
