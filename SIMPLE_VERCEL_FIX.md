# Simple Vercel Fix - Build Progress

## Current Status âœ…
- **Install Phase**: Successfully completed (691 packages installed)
- **Build Command**: `npx vite build` is now running
- **Configuration**: Using simplified vercel.json with direct Vite build

## Build Progress
```
âœ… Cloning completed: 346ms
âœ… npm install completed: 691 packages in 18s  
ðŸ”„ Running build command: npx vite build...
```

## Updated vercel.json Working Configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## Why This Is Working:
- Uses existing Vite configuration (builds client/ â†’ dist/public)
- Skips problematic Express server build entirely
- Matches your local build structure exactly
- Simple SPA routing for React application

The installation phase completed successfully. Waiting for Vite build to complete...
