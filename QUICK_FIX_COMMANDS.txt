# Quick Fix - Run these commands one by one in your Mac terminal

# First, cancel the current command (press Ctrl+C)

# Then run these commands:

cd ~/Downloads
ls -la

# Look for a folder that contains your Replit download (workspace, lush-properties-platform, etc.)
# Once you see the folder name, replace "ACTUAL_FOLDER_NAME" below with that name

cd ~/lush-properties-platform-v2

# Copy the files (replace ACTUAL_FOLDER_NAME with the real folder name you saw)
rsync -av --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' ~/Downloads/ACTUAL_FOLDER_NAME/ .

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Advanced UI/UX Polish & Infrastructure Suite"
git push origin main
