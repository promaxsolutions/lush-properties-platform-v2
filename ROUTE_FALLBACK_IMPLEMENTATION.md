# SPA Routing Fix for 404 Errors

## Progress Update âœ…
- **Login page loads**: MIME type errors resolved
- **Dashboard accessible**: Core app functionality working
- **Issue**: Client-side routing causing 404s on navigation/logout

## Problem Analysis
After login, React Router tries to navigate to `/dashboard` but Vercel server doesn't recognize this route, returning 404 instead of serving the React app.

## Solution: Add SPA Fallback Routing

**Updated vercel.json** with route fallback:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public", 
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## Terminal Commands:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform

# Add SPA routing fallback
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install", 
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
EOF

git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add SPA routing fallback to fix 404 navigation errors"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Fixes Navigation:
- All routes (`/dashboard`, `/logout`, etc.) fallback to `index.html`
- React Router handles client-side routing properly
- No more 404 errors on navigation or logout
- Maintains direct URL access to any page

This should resolve the navigation and logout 404 issues while preserving the working login functionality.
