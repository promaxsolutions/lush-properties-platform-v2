SIMPLE WORKING DEPLOYMENT - Final Solution

STATUS: API endpoints work perfectly but homepage routing is broken.

DIAGNOSIS: 
- ✅ API health check works: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-07-25T02:48:22.945Z","version":"ultra-simplified"}
- ❌ Homepage returns: "Cannot GET /"
- This suggests Vercel routing configuration issue or build cache problem

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

OPTION 1: Check if deployment actually happened
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
git log --oneline -5
```

OPTION 2: Force Vercel rebuild by touching package.json
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
touch package.json
git add .
git commit -m "Force Vercel rebuild - touch package.json"
git push origin main
```

OPTION 3: Check vercel.json configuration
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
cat vercel.json
```

OPTION 4: Manual Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "lush-properties-platform-v2" project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Check latest deployment status
5. Look for any build errors or failures

OPTION 5: Nuclear option - Create new Vercel project
If deployment keeps failing, create fresh project:
1. Fork GitHub repo to new name
2. Create new Vercel project from new repo
3. Import environment variables

The API backend is 100% functional, so this is purely a deployment/routing issue.

EXPECTED RESULT: After successful deployment, homepage should show:
- Green background (#007144)
- Gold text (#FFD700) 
- "Lush Properties Pty Ltd" heading
- Portal navigation buttons
- "✅ HOMEPAGE WORKING" indicator
