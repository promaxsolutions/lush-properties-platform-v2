# Manual Vercel Fix - Your Repo is Missing Changes

## Problem
Your local repository doesn't have the updated vercel.json file I created here in Replit. This is why "nothing to commit" appears.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Copy the Fixed vercel.json
1. **Copy the content** from `vercel-config-fix.json` (in this Replit)
2. **Replace your local vercel.json** with this content:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "lush-properties-platform",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Then commit and push**:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix: Update Vercel config for static site deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Direct Vercel Dashboard Fix
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Settings â†’ General
3. Set these values:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `vite build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. Save and redeploy

## Why This Happened
The vercel.json changes I made are in this Replit environment, but your local copy doesn't have them. That's why Git says "nothing to commit."

## Expected Result
After either fix, your Vercel site will show the actual React application instead of raw JavaScript code.
