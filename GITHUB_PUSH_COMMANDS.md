# Execute These Commands on Your MacBook

## Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
```

## Check Current Status
```bash
pwd
git status
git log --oneline -3
```

## Add All Changes and Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Final Vercel deployment fix with static build system"
git push origin main
```

## What This Deploys
- Updated vercel.json with @vercel/static-build configuration
- Uses your working `npm run build` command
- Points to correct `dist/public` output directory
- Implements proper SPA routing for React

## After Push Completes
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Monitor Build**: Look for automatic deployment from new commit
3. **If Still Fails**: Use dashboard override settings in VERCEL_DASHBOARD_STEPS.md

## Expected Result
✅ Vercel build succeeds using static build system
✅ React app deploys to production URL
✅ All routes work with SPA fallback
✅ Login functionality accessible

Run these commands in your terminal to deploy the comprehensive fix.
