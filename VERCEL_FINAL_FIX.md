# Vercel Final Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
- Build failing with "npx vite build" exited with 1
- Netlify shows 404 errors (incorrect routing)
- Need comprehensive Vercel configuration

## Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json for Static Build System
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Verified Build Script
- Uses `npm run build` (works locally)
- Outputs to `dist/public` directory
- Vite config properly configured for production

### 3. Git Commands to Deploy
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
git add .
git commit -m "Final Vercel deployment fix with static build"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- Vercel detects new commit
- Uses @vercel/static-build instead of direct vite
- Successfully builds using npm run build
- Serves React app from dist/public
- All routes work with SPA fallback to index.html

## Verification Steps
1. Check Vercel dashboard for successful build
2. Visit deployed URL
3. Test navigation between routes
4. Confirm React app loads properly

This configuration leverages Vercel's optimized static build system designed for React applications.
