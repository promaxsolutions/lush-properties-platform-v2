# Final Vercel Build Fix

## Problem Identified
The build fails because I incorrectly assumed your React app was in a `client` directory, but it's actually in the root with Vite configured to look in the `client` folder for source files.

## Correct Configuration

### Updated vercel.json:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

### Why This Works:
- `npx vite build` - Runs from root directory
- `dist/public` - Matches your Vite config output directory
- No directory changes needed

## Push This Fix:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix: Correct Vercel build paths for root-level Vite config"
git push origin main
```

## Alternative Dashboard Settings:
If you prefer dashboard configuration:
- Build Command: `npx vite build`
- Output Directory: `dist/public`
- Install Command: `npm install`

This matches your existing Vite configuration that builds from root and outputs to `dist/public`.
