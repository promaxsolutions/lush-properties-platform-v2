# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
Your Vercel deployment is showing the codebase instead of the built application. This happens when Vercel treats it as a static file hosting instead of a web application.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update vercel.json (Recommended)
I've updated your `vercel.json` to use the correct static build configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "lush-properties-platform",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard Settings
In your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Go to Settings â†’ General
2. Set Framework Preset to "Vite"
3. Set Build Command to: `vite build`
4. Set Output Directory to: `dist`
5. Set Install Command to: `npm install`

### Option 3: Add build script
Make sure your package.json has the build script that Vercel expects:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

## Steps to Fix

1. **Push the updated vercel.json** to your GitHub repository
2. **Redeploy** in Vercel dashboard (or it will auto-deploy from GitHub)
3. **Check build logs** in Vercel to ensure `vite build` runs successfully
4. **Verify** the app loads at your URL

## Expected Result
After the fix, your URL should show the actual Lush Properties login page instead of the file listing.

## If Still Not Working
- Check Vercel build logs for errors
- Ensure `dist/index.html` is being generated
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check that `vite build` works locally
