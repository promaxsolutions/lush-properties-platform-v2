GITHUB DESKTOP DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

Since you have GitHub Desktop, this is actually easier! Here's how to deploy:

STEP 1: CREATE THE FILES
First, we need to create/update these files in your Downloads folder:

File 1: ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform/vercel.json
File 2: ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform/api/index.js

STEP 2: GITHUB DESKTOP PROCESS
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It should show your "lush-properties-platform" repository
3. You'll see the changed files in the left sidebar
4. Add a commit message like: "Fix homepage routing - final deployment"
5. Click "Commit to main"
6. Click "Push origin" to deploy to Vercel

STEP 3: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
After pushing, wait 3-5 minutes then check:
- https://lush-properties-platform-v2.vercel.app/
- https://lush-properties-platform-v2.vercel.app/builder

Let me create the exact files you need to copy into your project...
