# Final Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Analysis
Build fails because:
1. Client directory has no separate package.json
2. Vite config builds from client directory but outputs to dist/public
3. Need to use root-level build process

## Corrected Configuration

**Updated vercel.json** (uses root build with Vite only):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public", 
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## Terminal Commands:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform

# Use simple Vite build from root
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
EOF

git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Use direct Vite build to fix deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Works
- Uses existing Vite configuration (builds from client/ to dist/public)
- Skips problematic server build entirely  
- Matches your working local build structure
- Proper SPA routing for React app

This should build successfully and serve your React application correctly.
