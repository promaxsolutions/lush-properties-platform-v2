FINAL DEPLOYMENT DIAGNOSIS - PERSISTENT ISSUE

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
You've run deployment commands 3+ times, but the homepage still returns "Cannot GET /" while API endpoints work perfectly. This indicates a fundamental issue beyond just file configuration.

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ API Infrastructure: Working perfectly
✅ Vercel Connection: Active (API responses prove this)
❌ Frontend Routing: Completely broken despite multiple deployments
❌ Git Sync: Changes not taking effect

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The issue is likely one of these:

1. GITHUB REPOSITORY MISMATCH
   - Vercel is connected to wrong repository
   - Or repository has different name/location

2. VERCEL PROJECT CONFIGURATION
   - Project settings pointing to wrong build directory
   - Framework preset incorrectly configured

3. DEPLOYMENT OVERRIDE
   - Old deployment cache preventing new code from activating
   - Vercel using cached build instead of new code

DEFINITIVE SOLUTION STEPS:

STEP 1: VERIFY GITHUB REPOSITORY
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
pwd  # Confirm you're in right directory
git remote -v  # Check if repository URL is correct
git log --oneline -3  # See if your commits are there

STEP 2: MANUAL VERCEL DASHBOARD FIX
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: "lush-properties-platform-v2" 
3. Click on the project
4. Go to Settings tab
5. Check "Git Repository" - ensure it matches your GitHub repo
6. Go to "Deployments" tab
7. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
8. Watch build logs for any errors

STEP 3: NUCLEAR OPTION - CREATE NEW VERCEL PROJECT
If above doesn't work:
1. In Vercel dashboard, create new project
2. Connect to your GitHub repository
3. Import fresh with these settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: (leave empty)
   - Install Command: npm install

STEP 4: ALTERNATIVE - MANUAL FILE CHECK
Run this to see what's actually in your repository:
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
ls -la
cat vercel.json
cat api/index.js | head -20

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Since the API proves Vercel is working, the most likely issue is:
1. Wrong repository linked to Vercel project
2. Vercel caching old deployment
3. Build configuration issue in Vercel dashboard

The simplest fix is to manually redeploy in Vercel dashboard or create a fresh Vercel project connected to your GitHub repository.

Your code changes ARE being made (you've confirmed running commands), but Vercel isn't using them. This is a deployment configuration issue, not a code issue.
