FINAL DIAGNOSIS AND SOLUTION

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Git pushes are successful (commits: 68d3cbc, 3451108)
- API endpoints work perfectly (health check returns data)
- Homepage routes are being added to api/index.js
- BUT Vercel is still serving "Cannot GET /" error

ROOT CAUSE: 
Vercel is either:
1. Using cached deployment from before the fixes
2. Build is failing silently 
3. vercel.json routing configuration issue

DEFINITIVE SOLUTION:

1. FIRST: Check if the route was actually added:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform
tail -15 api/index.js
```

2. IF ROUTE IS MISSING, add it manually:
```bash
# Open api/index.js and add this before the last line (module.exports = app;):

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head><title>Lush Properties Pty Ltd</title></head>
    <body style="background:#007144;color:white;text-align:center;padding:50px;">
      <h1 style="color:#FFD700;">üèòÔ∏è Lush Properties Pty Ltd</h1>
      <p>Premium Property Investment Management Platform</p>
      <a href="/builder" style="color:#FFD700;margin:10px;">Builder Portal</a>
      <a href="/client" style="color:#FFD700;margin:10px;">Client Portal</a>
      <div style="margin-top:30px;color:#90EE90;">‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT WORKING</div>
    </body>
    </html>
  `);
});
```

3. FORCE NEW DEPLOYMENT:
```bash
git add . -A
git commit -m "FORCE DEPLOY: Add homepage route definitively"
git push origin main
```

4. ALTERNATIVE: Check Vercel Dashboard
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Find "lush-properties-platform-v2" project
- Check deployment logs for any build errors
- Look for "Building" status

5. IF STILL FAILING: Nuclear Option
```bash
# Touch vercel.json to force complete rebuild
touch vercel.json
git add .
git commit -m "Force complete Vercel rebuild"
git push origin main
```

The API backend is 100% working (health check proves this), so this is purely a routing/deployment cache issue.
