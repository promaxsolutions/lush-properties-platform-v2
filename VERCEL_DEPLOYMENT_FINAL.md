# Complete Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Analysis
Your application has a complex structure where:
- Vite config sets `root: "client"` for source files
- Build outputs to `dist/public` 
- Vercel expects a simpler structure

## New Approach: Simplified Static Deployment

### Updated vercel.json:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Push These Changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Vercel deployment configuration with API functions"
git push origin main
```

### Alternative: Pure Static Deployment
If the above doesn't work, use this simpler vercel.json:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": null
}
```

This will deploy your React app as a static site which should work correctly with your current build setup.

## Expected Result:
- ✅ Build succeeds using your existing npm run build script
- ✅ Static files served from correct directory  
- ✅ App loads at https://lush-properties-platform-v2.vercel.app/
- ✅ Routing works correctly for /dashboard and other routes
