# VERCEL MIME TYPE FIX

## The Real Issue
The error shows JavaScript files are being served as HTML (MIME type 'text/html'), which means:
1. The build output directory is wrong
2. Static assets aren't being served properly
3. All requests are falling back to index.html

## Immediate Fix

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/projects/lush-properties-platform

# Create proper vercel.json with correct build configuration
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

git add .
git commit -m "Fixed build output directory and MIME types"
git push origin main
```

This explicitly tells Vercel:
- Use `npm run build` to build the project
- Look for static files in `dist/public` 
- Route API calls to backend
- Serve index.html for all other routes

The MIME type error should be resolved once Vercel knows where to find the actual JavaScript files.
