# MIME Type Error Fix

## Error Analysis
The console shows:
- `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module but got HTML`
- Service Worker and Manifest errors
- Build assets not being served correctly

## Root Cause
Vercel's static build system is incorrectly serving HTML for JS assets. The route fallback is interfering with asset delivery.

## Fix: Simplified vercel.json
Replace complex routing with simple build configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

## Terminal Commands:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform

# Create simplified vercel.json
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build", 
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
EOF

# Push the fix
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Simplify Vercel config to fix MIME type errors"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Works
- Removes complex routing that interferes with asset serving
- Uses simple build + output directory approach
- Lets Vercel handle SPA routing automatically
- Ensures JS/CSS assets serve with correct MIME types

This should resolve the module loading errors and display your React app properly.
