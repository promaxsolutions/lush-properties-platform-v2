Since the automated script cannot run due to Git security restrictions, follow these exact steps in your terminal:

## Step 1: Clean Up Git Lock Files
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
rm -f .git/refs/heads/main.lock
```

## Step 2: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

## Step 3: Stage All Files
```bash
git add .
