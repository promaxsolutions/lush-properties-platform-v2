# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

## Git Push Successful!
**Commit**: `24d4620` - "Fixed SPA routing with rewrites configuration"
**Status**: Pushed to GitHub successfully
**Auto-Deploy**: Vercel will detect changes within 1-2 minutes

## What Was Fixed:
- **Simplified Configuration**: Replaced complex routes with clean rewrites
- **SPA Fallback**: All non-API routes now properly serve index.html
- **React Router Support**: Frontend can handle all routing client-side
- **API Routing**: Backend endpoints work correctly

## Monitor Deployment:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "lush-properties-platform-v2" project  
3. Watch deployment status: "Building" â†’ "Ready"
4. Estimated completion: 3 minutes

## Test After Deployment:
Once "Ready" status appears:
- Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/login` (should work, no 404)
- Login: admin@lush.com / admin123
- Navigate: All React Router paths should function

## Expected Results:
âœ… No more 404 errors on any route
âœ… Login system works perfectly
âœ… Dashboard loads with demo projects
âœ… Complete React Router navigation

The SPA routing issue should now be completely resolved!
