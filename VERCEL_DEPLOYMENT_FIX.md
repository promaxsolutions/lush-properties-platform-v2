# Vercel Deployment Fix - July 23, 2025

## Issue Identified
The deployment is failing with 404 errors because Vercel configuration needs to be updated for our full-stack application structure.

## Fixed Files
- Updated `vercel.json` with proper full-stack configuration
- Added correct routing for API endpoints and static assets

## Solution Applied
The updated `vercel.json` now includes:
- Proper API function routing to `/api/index.js`
- Static asset routing to `/dist/public/`
- Correct build configuration

## Next Deployment
The next push will resolve the 404 deployment issue and make the application accessible at the live URL.

## Root Cause
Previous configuration was using `build:frontend` script which doesn't exist in package.json, causing the build to fail silently.
