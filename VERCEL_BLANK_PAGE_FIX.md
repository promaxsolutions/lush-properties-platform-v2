# Fix Blank Page - Import Alias Issue

## Problem
- Vercel deployment shows blank page
- HTML loads but React doesn't mount
- JavaScript errors due to unresolved "@/" imports

## Root Cause
Your GitHub repository still has UI components using "@/" aliases that Vercel can't resolve:
- client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
- client/src/components/ui/resizable.tsx
- client/src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx
- And many more...

## Quick Fix: Update App.tsx Import
The main issue is in App.tsx line 5:

**Current (BROKEN)**:
```tsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
```

**Fixed**:
```tsx
import { Toaster } from "./components/ui/toaster";
```

## Terminal Commands to Fix:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/lush-properties-platform

# Fix the main App.tsx import
sed -i 's|from "@/components/ui/toaster"|from "./components/ui/toaster"|g' client/src/App.tsx

# Push the fix
git add client/src/App.tsx
git commit -m "Fix toaster import for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- Vercel redeploys automatically
- React app mounts properly
- Login page displays instead of blank page
- Site becomes functional

This single import fix should resolve the blank page issue.
