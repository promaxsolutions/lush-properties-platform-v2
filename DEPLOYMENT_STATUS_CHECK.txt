DEPLOYMENT STATUS VERIFICATION

‚úÖ TERMINAL COMMANDS EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY
‚úÖ API ENDPOINTS WORKING (health check returns: {"status":"healthy"})
‚ùå HOMEPAGE STILL SHOWING "Cannot GET /" (old deployment)

STATUS: Vercel rebuild in progress

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
- Your git push was successful
- Vercel detected the changes and started rebuilding
- API endpoints are working (proves backend is deployed)
- Homepage route needs to finish deploying

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Check Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for "Building" or "Deploying" status
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 3-5 minutes)
4. Test homepage again: https://lush-properties-platform-v2.vercel.app/

EXPECTED RESULT AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
- Homepage will show: "üèòÔ∏è Lush Properties Pty Ltd" with green background
- Portal links for Builder, Client, Admin, Investor will work
- All existing API endpoints remain functional

If homepage still shows "Cannot GET /" after 10 minutes:
- Check Vercel dashboard for any build errors
- Verify the files were committed correctly with: git log --oneline -1
