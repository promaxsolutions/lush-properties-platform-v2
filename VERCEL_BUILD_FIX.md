# Vercel Build Progress Update

## Current Status: âœ… SUCCESS SO FAR

### What's Working:
- Repository cloned successfully (343ms)
- npm install completed (691 packages, 18s)
- No critical dependency issues
- Build process initiated with correct settings

### Expected Next Steps:
1. Vercel runs `npm run build` command
2. Vite builds React app to `dist/public` directory  
3. Static files deployed to production
4. Site becomes accessible at production URL

### If Build Completes Successfully:
- Visit your Vercel dashboard deployment URL
- Test login functionality
- Navigate between routes
- Confirm React app loads properly

### If Build Still Fails:
Look for specific error messages in the build log, typically related to:
- Import resolution issues
- Missing dependencies  
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Vite configuration problems

The npm install phase completed without critical errors, which is a good sign. The override settings should now allow the build to complete successfully.
