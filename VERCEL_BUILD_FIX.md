# Vercel Build Success - Final Configuration

## ✅ Build Issue Resolved
The build is now working successfully! The toast component was fine - it was a TypeScript issue that's been fixed.

## Current Working Configuration

### vercel.json:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Build Output (Success):
```
✓ 2201 modules transformed.
../dist/public/index.html                     2.19 kB │ gzip:   0.95 kB
../dist/public/assets/index--Ry9gK6O.css     89.03 kB │ gzip:  14.79 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-D55hosAL.js   1,266.01 kB │ gzip: 348.47 kB

```

## Push This Working Version:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix TypeScript error and confirm working build"
git push origin main
```

## What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in App.tsx (line 124) by adding proper Record type
- ✅ Confirmed toast components are working correctly
- ✅ Build produces correct output in `dist/public/`
- ✅ All file paths and imports resolved successfully

## Expected Vercel Result:
- Build will succeed using the working npm run build
- Files will be served from dist/public/ correctly
- React Router will handle all routes via index.html
- Site should load at https://lush-properties-platform-v2.vercel.app/

The build is now production-ready for Vercel deployment.
