# Vercel Build Fix - July 23, 2025

## Issue
Vercel build failing with: `npm error Missing script: "build:frontend"`

## Root Cause
The vercel.json was referencing a non-existent build script.

## Solution Applied
1. Updated vercel.json to use @vercel/static-build
2. Configure to use existing "build" script from package.json
3. Set correct output directory to dist/public

## Fixed Configuration
- Uses standard Vercel static build process
- Points to correct build output directory
- Removes dependency on custom build commands

## Expected Result
Next deployment will succeed and app will be fully accessible.
