## Development Notes

The application uses a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types between client and server. The development server includes error overlay and live reloading via Vite plugins. File uploads are restricted to common document and image formats with a 10MB size limit. The UI follows a neutral color scheme with dark mode support through CSS variables. Authentication is currently mocked for demo purposes but can be easily replaced with real Firebase configuration.
