# URGENT: Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
Your Vercel site is showing raw JavaScript code instead of the React application because it's treating it as a serverless function instead of a static site.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Update vercel.json (Already Done)
I've updated your `vercel.json` to use static build configuration instead of serverless functions.

### 2. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update Vercel config for static site deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Redeploy in Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project: lush-properties-platform-v2
- Click "Redeploy" 
- Or wait for auto-deployment from GitHub

### 4. Alternative: Manual Vercel Settings
If the above doesn't work, in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Set Framework Preset: **Vite**
3. Set Build Command: **vite build**
4. Set Output Directory: **dist**
5. Set Install Command: **npm install**
6. Save and redeploy

## Expected Result
After the fix, your URL should show:
- ✅ Lush Properties login page
- ✅ React application interface
- ✅ NOT raw JavaScript code

## Root Cause
The original vercel.json was configured for serverless functions, but your app is a client-side React application that should be served statically after building with Vite.

## If Still Not Working
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure `dist/index.html` exists after build
3. Verify package.json has: `"build": "vite build"`
